# Fast Tasks – Patch Notes  
## Version `0.1.4-alpha` – *May 31, 2025*

### ✨ New Features
- **Partial Live Sidebar Sync**: Sidebar now attempts to refresh when tasks are modified—works for task creation and toggling priority in edit mode.
- **Preview Mode Compatibility**: Most commands (e.g. rescheduling and toggling priority) now work even when the editor is in Preview mode.
- **Safe View Registration**: Prevents plugin crashes during development by avoiding duplicate sidebar view registration.

### ✅ Improvements & Fixes
- 🧠 **Toggle Priority** now correctly updates the currently selected task.
- ♻️ Improved sidebar view activation logic.
- 🧼 Minor code cleanups and command reliability boosts.

---

### 🧪 Known Issues (Planned for `0.1.5-alpha`)
- 🔄 Sidebar does **not fully auto-refresh** after rescheduling tasks.
- 🧩 Full sync in Preview mode still needs refinement.
