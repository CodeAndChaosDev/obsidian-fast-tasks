# 🧩 Patch Notes — `v0.1.3-alpha`

**Date:** 2025-05-30
**Tag:** `v0.1.3-alpha`
**Status:** Alpha / In Development

---

## ✨ New Features

### 🔼 Task Reordering (Move Up/Down)

* You can now move tasks up or down using hotkeys:

  * `Ctrl + ↑` (Move Up)
  * `Ctrl + ↓` (Move Down)
* Moves the **currently selected** task (based on cursor position).
* Cursor follows the moved task after repositioning.

---

## 🛠 Fixes & Improvements

### ✅ **Toggle Priority Fixed**

* `Toggle Priority` now properly cycles the task's priority (`🔥 → ⚠ → 💤 → 🔥`).
* Works on the task under your cursor (not just the first task in file anymore).

### 🕒 Reschedule Task Polishing

* `Ctrl + R` now reliably triggers the Reschedule Task command.
* Works on the selected task line, allowing inline update of `@HH:mm` time.
* Integrated with Command Palette and hotkey support.

---

## 📁 Plugin Internals

* Refactored `TaskManager` to consistently use `getTasksFromActiveFile()` + cursor awareness for better UX.
* Line swapping logic for reordering now safely handles out-of-bounds cases.

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

* Task parsing is still basic — only tasks starting with `- [ ]` and a valid priority are recognized.
* Sidebar still only displays header — task listing & filtering coming in next versions.

---

## 🧪 What's Next (0.2.0-alpha Preview)

* Sidebar task rendering & filtering
* Task editing via modal
* Task completion support (`- [x]`)
* Tag filtering by `#tags`
* Support for sorting by time, duration, priority
