### 📦 `0.1.2-alpha.md` – Patch Notes

**Date:** 2025-05-30
**Tag:** `v0.1.2-alpha`
**Status:** Alpha / In Development

---

### 🚀 Features Added

* **🕒 Reschedule Task**

  * New command added: `Reschedule Task` (`Ctrl+R`).
  * Prompts for a new time (e.g. `14:30`) and updates the `@time` in-place on the selected task line.
  * Available via Command Palette or hotkey.

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* 🛠️ Fixed ribbon icon not opening sidebar correctly.
* 🛠️ Sidebar now properly registers via `this.registerView(...)` and shows the task view when clicked.
* 🛠️ Hotkeys (Ctrl+T for modal, Ctrl+R for reschedule) now functional.
* 🛠️ Task parsing now supports flexible formats (`🔥`, `⚠`, `💤` + optional `@time`, `(duration)`, and `#tags`).

---

### 🧪 Improvements & Refactors

* Improved **TaskManager.ts** to support modular methods for toggling, inserting, and rescheduling.
* Laid groundwork for future logic like:

  * Moving tasks up/down
  * Cycling through priority levels
  * Sidebar task filtering
* `SidebarView` now initialized with heading & container setup.
* Modal components now reuse `obsidian`'s native UI components (e.g., `TextComponent`, `ButtonComponent`) for consistency.

---

### 🔧 Dev Notes

* ⚠ `moveTask()` and `togglePriority()` are currently placeholders — implementation next.
* Task parsing still happens inline; in future releases, we’ll extract task parsing to a helper utility for easier filtering and sidebar rendering.

---

### 🔜 Next Release Goals (`0.1.2-alpha`)

* [ ] Optimize Load and parse tasks from file(s) into the SidebarView.
* [ ] Add filters: by tag, priority, or time.
* [ ] Imrpvoe `moveTask(direction)` for arrow movement.
* [ ] Improve `togglePriority()` to cycle `🔥 > ⚠ > 💤`.
* [ ] Design a lightweight task parser for consistent task formatting and extraction.
