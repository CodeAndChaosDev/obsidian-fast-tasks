# Fast Tasks – Patch Notes  
## Version `0.1.5-alpha` – *June 2, 2025*

### 🔄 Improvements

* **Live Rescheduling Fix**: Tasks in the “Auto-updated” section now correctly refresh when a task is edited — no longer requires reopening the modal.
* **Task Priority Icons**: Tasks now display proper icons for `Low 💤`, `Medium ⚠️`, and `High 🔥` urgency levels.
* **Improved Parsing**: Task titles with time like `@15:30` and priorities are now parsed more reliably.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

* ✅ Fixed: Tasks not updating live in the “Your Tasks (Auto-updated)” panel.
* ✅ Fixed: Duplicate or stale task states when opening modals multiple times.
* ✅ Fixed: Task checkboxes desynced from UI after editing.

### 🚧 Known Issues (Deferred to `0.2.0-beta`)

* ❌ ETA `(20min)` is removed on refresh — duration not retained after parsing/render.
* ❌ Minor visual inconsistencies between the auto-updated view and the original source block.
